                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War is an action-adventure, hack and slash, mythology-based video game series, originally created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. Debuting in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console, the series has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of seven games across multiple platforms with an eighth currently in development. The series' story centers around its playable character, Kratos, a Spartan warrior tricked into killing his wife and daughter by his former master, the Greek God of War Ares. Kratos kills Ares at the behest of the goddess Athena and takes his place as the new God of War, but is still haunted by the nightmares of his past. Revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods who betrays Kratos, the Spartan then seeks revenge against the gods for their machinations. What follows is a series of attempts to free himself from the influence of the gods and the Titans and exact revenge. Many years after taking his revenge against the Greek gods, Kratos ends up in the world of the Norse gods with a son named Atreus and takes a turn for the good.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4 style="color: #FAFAFA;">First era (Greek mythology)</h4>
                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War was first released in North America on March 22, 2005, for the PlayStation 2. After ten years in the service of the Olympian gods, Spartan soldier Kratos is tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box; the key to defeating Ares, the God of War, who is running amok through Athens. A series of flashbacks reveals that Kratos was once the servant of Ares, who saved the Spartan and his army from annihilation in battle, but tricked him into killing his family which forced his metamorphosis into the "Ghost of Sparta". Kratos eventually finds Pandora's Box, and after finally killing Ares, he ascends to Mount Olympus to become the new God of War.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War II was first released in North America on March 13, 2007, for the PlayStation 2. Angered at his fellow gods, Kratos runs amok across the city of Rhodes. Zeus intervenes and betrays Kratos, who is saved by the Titan Gaia. She tells him he must now find the Sisters of Fate, who can change his fate and prevent his death at the hands of Zeus. Kratos is ultimately successful and as he is about to kill the god, Athena sacrifices herself to save Zeus and preserve Olympus, and tells Kratos that he is the son of Zeus. Kratos then joins forces with Gaia and the Titans to attack Olympus.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War: Betrayal was released on June 20, 2007, for mobile phones supporting Java ME. It is the only game in the series to be released as a two-dimensional (2D) side-scroller and released on a non-PlayStation platform. The game's narrative takes place between the events of Ghost of Sparta and God of War II. Kratos is framed for murder, and rampages across Greece seeking the true assassin. Kratos succumbs to bloodlust and kills Ceryx, the son of the god Hermes—an act that alienates him from his fellow gods.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War: Chains of Olympus was first released in North America on March 4, 2008, for the PlayStation Portable. Its narrative takes place during Kratos' ten years of service to the gods. Kratos halts a Persian invasion of the Greek city of Attica, and learns that the world has been plunged into darkness by the god Morpheus. Kratos investigates the abduction of the sun god Helios, and prevents the Machiavellian plan of the goddess Persephone to use the Titan Atlas to destroy the world.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War III was first released in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon abandoned by the Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated to a new level of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself is the key to pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War: Ghost of Sparta was first released in North America on November 2, 2010, for the PlayStation Portable. Set between the events of God of War and Betrayal, Kratos, the God of War, is still haunted by visions of his mortal past and embarks on a quest to discover his origins by finding his mother, Callisto. He learns that his brother Deimos was taken by the gods and imprisoned by the God of Death, Thanatos, and decides to find and save his sibling. Although successful, Thanatos engages the brothers in combat, and kills Deimos. Kratos then kills Thanatos and returns to Olympus, further enraged at the gods.</p>

                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">God of War: Ascension was first released in North America on March 12, 2013, for the PlayStation 3. It is the only game in the series to feature multiplayer for both competitive and cooperative play. Set six months after Kratos killed his wife and child, he has been imprisoned by the three Furies for breaking his blood oath to Ares. With the help of the oath keeper Orkos, Kratos learns that Ares and the Furies plan to overthrow Mount Olympus. The Spartan escapes his imprisonment, subsequently killing the Furies, and Orkos, who begs for release. Although free of Ares' bond, Kratos begins to suffer the nightmares that plague him for years.</p>

                                <h4 style="color: #FAFAFA;">Second era (Norse mythology)</h4>
                                <p style="color: #FAFAFA; text-align: justify; font-weight: 100;">The next installment, also titled God of War, was officially announced at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer. The trailer showed a fully bearded Kratos, who now has a son, and Kratos is teaching the boy how to hunt. The end of the trailer showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, as well as a Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. The game will take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods. Although further games have not been officially announced, Cory Barlog confirmed that this new installment would not be Kratos' last game. It was also revealed that following games will be set in the Norse environment, and include Atreus. At E3 2017, another trailer was shown, and in January 2018, the release date was revealed as April 20, 2018. Sony also partnered with Facebook to develop a text-based game titled God of War: A Call from the Wilds through Facebook Messenger. Released on February 1, 2018, the short story follows Atreus on his first adventure in the Norse wilds.</p>
